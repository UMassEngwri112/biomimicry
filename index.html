                            The biomimicry of silk in the past 400 BCE was not limited to the production of textiles. Silk was also used to create a
                            variety of other products, including fishing lines, musical instruments, and medical devices. The Chinese were
                            particularly skilled at using silk to create intricate and beautiful works of art.
                            
                            The biomimicry of silk continued to flourish in the centuries after 400 BCE. As new civilizations discovered the secrets
                            of silk production, they began to develop their own unique silk-making traditions. For example, the Persians were known
                            for their vibrant silk brocades, while the Byzantines were known for their shimmering silk mosaics.
                            
                            Today, silk remains a popular and versatile material. It is used in a wide variety of products, from clothing and
                            textiles to medical implants and tissue engineering scaffolds. The biomimicry of silk continues to inspire scientists
                            and engineers, who are constantly developing new ways to use this remarkable material to improve our lives.

                <h2 class="underline">Bullet Train and the Kingfisher.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is perhaps my personal favorite example of biomimicry. The Japanese shinkansen bullet train was inspired by the kingfisher, a bird that can dive into water at high speeds
                        without creating much splash. The engineers designed the train's nose to resemble the kingfisher's beak, which helps to
                        reduce drag and noise. The train's body is also streamlined, which helps it to move through the air more efficiently.<br>
                        
                        In addition, the shinkansen's wheels are covered in a special material that helps to reduce friction and noise. The
                        train also has a suspension system that helps to absorb vibrations, making for a smoother ride.<br>
                        
                        As a result of these biomimetic design features, the shinkansen is able to travel at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph)
                        with very little noise or vibration. This makes it one of the fastest and most efficient trains in the world.<br>
                        
                        <span class="underline">Some of the specific ways in which the kingfisher inspired the design of the shinkansen bullet train:</span><br>
                        
                        i. The kingfisher's beak is long and slender, which helps it to pierce the water with minimal resistance. The
                        shinkansen's nose is similarly shaped, which helps to reduce drag and noise as the train travels through the air.<br>
                        
                        ii. The kingfisher's feathers are covered in a thin layer of oil, which helps to reduce the amount of water that sticks
                        to its body. The shinkansen's body is also covered in a special coating that helps to reduce drag and noise.<br>
                        
                        iii. The kingfisher's wings are designed to generate lift without creating much drag. The shinkansen's pantograph (the
                        device that collects electricity from the overhead power lines) is also designed to generate lift and reduce drag.<br>

            <p>Biomimetic scaling of noise reduction. Kingfisher's beak was transferred into the design of high-speed trains. These
            trains became quieter and more efficient requiring 15% less energy while traveling even faster than before. Train image
